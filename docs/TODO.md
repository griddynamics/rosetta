This file contains grep compatible list of very concise improvements, suggestions, large TODOs, etc. Do not create TOC, it should come from grep.

## REVIEW: Build dockerimage using UVX

**Status:** Proposed

**What**: src/rosetta-mcp-server/Dockerfile to use `uvx rosetta-mcp@<specific-version>` instead of `Python -m`. 

## REVIEW: Split plugins from marketplace

**What:** Have plugins.json extracted from marketplace and marketplace just references the file/folder. To make it reusable.

## TODO: Hooks — lint-format-advisory deferred

**Status:** Deferred — moved from `docs/plans/2026-05-05-lint-format-advisory.md`

- **Strict plan-step dedup** — read `plans/<name>/plan.json` and skip the advisory if a syntax/type/lint/format step is already present; currently only time-based throttle prevents double-nudge.
- **Actual linter invocation** — replace the advisory with on-demand execution of language-appropriate tooling (per-extension map: `ruff` for `.py`, `eslint`/`tsc` for `.ts`/`.js`, `prettier` for `.css`/`.html`, etc.).
- **Session-long throttle TTL** — extend `src/hooks/src/runtime/throttle.ts` with a per-hook `ttlMs` option so `lint-format-advisory` can dedupe per `(session, filePath)` for the entire session lifetime, not just 5 seconds.
